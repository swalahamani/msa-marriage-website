# ⚠️ ShadCN UI Components Usage Guidelines

## 🚫 Do Not Modify Original Components

- **Preserve Original Files**: Avoid making direct changes to the components located in `src/components/lib/shadcn/ui/`. These files are managed by the ShadCN CLI and may be overwritten during updates.
## ✅ Recommended Customization Approach

- **Create Wrapper Components**: For any custom behavior or styling, create wrapper components in a separate directory, such as `src/components/`.

- **Apply Tailwind CSS Classes**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes within wrapper components to maintain consistency.

## 🧠 AI Assistance Configuration

- **Restrict AI Modifications**: AI tools should avoid making changes to `src/components/lib/shadcn/ui/**`. Focus AI suggestions on wrapper components or consumption contexts.
