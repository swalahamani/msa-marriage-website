# Project Overview

This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Next.js** with **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ShadCN UI** components
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management

## Directory Structure

- `src/app/`: Contains Next.js pages and layouts.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `src/components/lib/shadcn/`: Components and utilities generated by the ShadCN CLI.
- `src/services/api/`: API service logic and Axios setup.
- `src/store/`: Redux Toolkit store and slices.
- `src/utils/`: Utility/helper functions.
- `src/styles/`: Tailwind-specific style constants.

## Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS classes directly in JSX for styling.
- ShadCN components are managed via the ShadCN CLI and located in `src/components/lib/shadcn/`.
- Maintain separation of concerns by organizing code into appropriate directories.
